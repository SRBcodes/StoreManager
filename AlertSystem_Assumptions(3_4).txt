3. Working of the Alerting system:

Considering a process that already handles the orders exist, there will be an additional check done while the items are removed from the inventory against the quantity.
If the quantity available is less than the threshold qty(w.r.t item_id/dept) which is stored in separate table, then the alert/notification is sent to the concerned team.

Additionally, we can have a job that runs every 5-10 mins that checks the inventory as the inventoryquantity can change due to expiry, damage or returned orders etc.




4. Assumptions made for this scenario:

1) Considering there is already separate service/process that handles the orders and reduces the quantity from the inventory.
2) There is only one item per department, single item cannot be part of multiple departments
3) There is a separate table/prcess that handles the price related information of the items categorized under specific departments.
4) Threshold quantity is maintained against the item/dept in a separate table.
5) Concurrency is already handled accounting for the race conditions.
